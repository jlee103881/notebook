    "Python is a high-level programming language designed to be readable and efficient.  \n",
    "It mixes **data (nouns)** and **instructions (verbs)** to express computation clearly.  \n",
    "This chapter introduces what programming is, how Python programs look, and how to run them either **interactively** in the Python shell or from a saved `.py` file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You learned that programming is like writing a recipe â€” there are ingredients (data) and steps (code).  \n",
    "The chapter also introduces Pythonâ€™s built-in tools, the standard library, and the interactive interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts & Explanations\n",
    "1. **Programs and Syntax** â€“ Python uses readable syntax (colons : indentation) to define blocks rather than braces.  \n",
    "2. **Variables** â€“ Names that refer to stored values; they can represent data for later use.  \n",
    "3. **Data Types** â€“ Basic forms of data such as integers, strings, and lists.  \n",
    "4. **The Interpreter** â€“ An interactive shell that executes Python code line by line.  \n",
    "5. **Scripts (.py Files)** â€“ Saved Python programs executed from the command line with `python filename.py`.  \n",
    "6. **Built-in Functions** â€“ Functions like `print()` or `input()` are available without imports.  \n",
    "7. **Standard Library and Imports** â€“ Reusable modules (e.g., `json`, `math`) you can import to extend functionality.\n",

    "- Forgetting quotation marks around text â†’ `print(Hello)` causes a `NameError`.  \n",

    "## ðŸ§© Chapter 2 â€“ Types and Variables\n",
    "This chapter explains how computers store data and how Python organizes that data using **types** and **variables**.  \n",
    "Every value in Python has a type, such as `int`, `float`, `str`, or `bool`.  \n",
    "A **variable** is simply a name that refers to an object in memory.  \n",
    "Python uses **dynamic typing**, so the type is determined at runtime and can change.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also learned naming conventions, mutability, and how variables act as labels pointing to objects in memory â€” not containers as in some other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts & Explanations\n",
    "1. **Variables as Names** â€“ Variables point to data in memory; they donâ€™t physically contain it.  \n",
    "2. **Assignment** â€“ `=` creates a link between a name and a value.  \n",
    "3. **Data Types** â€“ Integers, floats, booleans, and strings each store different forms of data.  \n",
    "4. **Type Checking** â€“ Use `type()` to inspect the type of a value.  \n",
    "5. **Naming Rules** â€“ Variable names must start with a letter or underscore and can contain letters and numbers.  \n",
    "6. **Mutability** â€“ Some data types (strings, tuples) are immutable; others (lists, dicts) are mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Mistakes\n",
    "- Using invalid variable names (e.g., starting with numbers).  \n",
    "- Forgetting quotes around strings.  \n",
    "- Mixing types in expressions without conversion.  \n",
    "- Assuming assignment copies values instead of references.\n",
